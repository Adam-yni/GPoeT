# Tiny Poetic LLM 

## About the Project

A small personal project to create a **tiny language model (LLM)** for generating poetry in French. The model contains **40M parameters** and was entirely trained on a **Kaggle notebook** (free tier with an NVIDIA P100 GPU, 16GB VRAM). 

### Features 
-  **Coherent verses**: The output is mostly consistent and meaningful (though very abstract at times..).  
-  **Adjustable creativity**: A temperature setting below `0.4` can yield surprisingly interesting results!  
-  **No rhymes (yet)**: The current model rarely rhymes. I hope that a second training phase using reinforcement learning will address this.

## Dataset 

The model was trained on a custom dataset containing **2.2M characters** compiled from public domain poetry collections on **Project Gutenberg**, featuring:  
- **Victor Hugo**  
- **Charles Baudelaire**  
- **Paul Verlaine**

### Tokenizer 
The tokenizer was built using **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** with a **tiny vocabulary of 128 tokens**, including:  
- Uppercase and lowercase letters.  
- Frequently recurring character groups.  

### Positional Encoding   
Used **RoPE (Rotary Positional Encoding)** for efficient handling of relative token positions.

## Training 

- Trained entirely on **Kaggle's free GPU environment**.  
- The model is compact and focuses on generating stylistically accurate poetry.

## Next Steps 

### Reinforcement Learning   
Developing a reinforcement learning algorithm inspired by **GFlowNets** (my approach is strongly inspired by this article https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04363) to enhance rhyme generation and improve thematic coherence while preserving diversity in the generated verses.

## Why Poetry?   

Poetry is a challenging and nuanced art form. This project explores how a simple LLM can generate creative text. We've all had to read a poem in school where some lines seemed completely abstract... Writing poetry makes the line between "the AI is just spouting nonsense" and "the AI is crafting those same weird verses we found confusing as kids" very, very blurry!

## Example Outputs   

With a **temperature < 0.4**, the model sometimes produces surprising and intriguing verses. Here's a sample output (with temperature = 0.1):  

## Generated French Poem

> *"Avec la mort des cheveux d'or,  
>     Le soir étend la mort.  
>  
> On voit dans l'ombre une âme invisible à l'homme.  
> L'homme est un soleil d'une fleur qui se déchire,  
>     L'amour est toujours nue  
> L'âme dans l'ombre des cieux s'en va fait la nuit.  
> L'homme est un vent se dresse et se lamente.  
>     L'homme est seul et la mort.  
> L'homme est un coeur en chemin s'élance et s'envole.  
> L'homme est un vent se dresse à l'ombre des cieux.  
>     L'amour est un ciel bleu  
> L'ombre des fleurs s'envole, [cut]."*

## Word-for-Word English Translation 

> *"With the death of the golden hairs,  
>     The evening spreads the death.  
>  
> We see in the shadow a soul invisible to the man.  
> The man is a sun of a flower which tears itself,  
>     Love is always naked  
> The soul in the shadow of the heavens goes away makes the night.  
> The man is a wind rises and laments.  
>     The man is alone and the death.  
> The man is a heart in the way launches itself and flies away.  
> The man is a wind rises in the shadow of the heavens.  
>     Love is a blue sky  
> The shadow of the flowers flies away,[cut]"*

### Notes on Generated Text 
This word-for-word translation keeps the structure and phrasing of the original poem without correcting any grammatical errors or inconsistencies.
